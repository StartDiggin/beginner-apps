                My name is Johnny, I am working on learning another language and I figured
                React was a good one to learn. Here are a few of my starter projects. Take a
                look and I hope this helps anyone who is trying to learn React and is out of 
                ideas of what to build. Thank you for stopping in, have a good one!!!
