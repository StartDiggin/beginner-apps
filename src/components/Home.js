import React from 'react'



const Home = () => {
    
    return <div className="section">
        <div className="home">
            <h1 className="pageHeading">Hello, welcome to my project page!</h1>

                My name is Johnny, I am working on learning another language and I figured
                React was a good one to learn. Here are a few of my starter projects. Take a
                look and I hope this helps anyone who is trying to learn React and is out of 
                ideas of what to build. I tried to stay away from putting too much into the styling
                and just tried to focus on the functionality of the app.
            </p>
            <span>
                Thank you for stopping in, have a good one!!!
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

export default Home
